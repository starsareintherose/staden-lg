    README file for help directory of staden package
    -----------------------------------------------

Should contain (at least) ProgramName_help where ProgramName is each of
bap, dap, gip, mem, mep, nip, nipf, pip, sap, sip and also staden_help
and stadenp_help.

There are 3 main formats of file in this directory:

PROGRAM.RNO:
	This is the unformatted (runoff/nroff style) help for PROGRAM.
	Any changes to the help should be performed on this file.

program_help:
	This is the online formatted help used by PROGRAM. It can also
	be printed to produce hardcopy documentation.

program_menu:
	This is a file that describes the menus used in PROGRAM,
	together with an index into the program_help file for the
	online help. The format for each line is:
	
	<option number> <menu number> <program_help offset> <no. of
	lines of help> <program type T(ext) or (X)windows> <option name>


Exceptions to these are for the staden_help, stadenp_help, and
splitp_help which do not have the relevant .RNO or _menu files. The
file staden_help gives an introduction to the xterm user interface
(written for vax and vms and so is out of date with the Unix
versions).

See the file splitp_help for information about the reformatting of the
PROSITE motif library.

Rebuild help files with the Unix command "make all". Ensure that the utility
program sethelp is compiled and in the executables search path. The sources
for the program sethelp are found in $STADENROOT/staden.

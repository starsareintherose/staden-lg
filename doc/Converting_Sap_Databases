Converting Sap Databases For Be Used With XDAP         SD  10 July 1991
=======================================================================

The sequence assembly programmes dap and xdap are based on the programs
sap and xsap, with major modifications. For a concise summary of the
new features I refer you to Rodger and my paper, "A sequence assembly
and editing program for efficient management of large projects"
(Nucleic Acids Research, in press)

The need for storing extra information in project databases has
resulted in the creation of two files. For users who wish you use old
(sap) databases with xdap, additional files must be created to use all
the new features. The program 'convert_project' does this.  It is
interactive, and asks you for names of relevant files, version numbers
etc. Here is a sample program dialogue:


    % convert_project
    Database conversion program
    Converts *.RD? file to *.TG? and *.CC? files

    Project name ? test
    Version ? 0
    Conversion completed.


Further, please ensure that the file TAGDB is in your project
directory. Copies can be found in $STADTABL.  Alternatively ensure that
the environment TAGDB variable is set to $STADTABL/TAGDB

    setenv TAGDB $STADTABL/TAGDB

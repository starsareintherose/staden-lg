Processing and printing LaTeX sources
-------------------------------------

Given a source file src.tex, run LaTeX to generate the bibliographic
references:

	latex src

Now run BibTeX to search the bibliography for them:

	bibtex src

Now run LaTeX twice, first to pick up the references, second to bind
forward references:

	latex src
	latex src

This will have generated a src.dvi output file. Now we convert this
to PostScript:

	dvi2ps src.dvi >src.ps

Now we can print this out:

	lpr src.ps

Most of the above is only necessay if you are building something from
scratch, but it's best to go through it anyway until you fully
understand how LaTeX works.

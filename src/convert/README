0. Introduction

The Staden package (version 1992.3 or greater) now includes the
sequence assembly program xbap. Xbap cannot be used with databases
created by the sequence assembly program xdap. People wanting to
switch to using the new software will need to convert their old
databases. The program `convert' is provided for this purpose.

1. The conversion program

`convert' (version 1.0) is an interactive program for converting
sequence assembly data between various formats. With it, it is
possible to convert data in any of the formats:

	text file (created by convert)
	xdap database
	xbap database

to any of the following formats:

	text file (created by convert)
	xbap database


2. Converting databases

The program takes no command line arguments. First, you are prompted
for the format, name and version of the database you wish to convert.
If the source is an xdap or xbap database, ensure that the name and
version are in uppercase. If the source is a text file, the version is
prompted for but it is ignored. Second, you are prompted for the
format, name and version of the database you wish to create. Ensure
that names and versions are in the appropriate case and that the files
do already exist.

After this, the programs converts the database. This may take some
time. The next message to appear on the terminal is a message to
indicate the conversion has successfully completed.


3. Example

Here is a log of a typical conversion session:

ted - trace editor
------------------
This is the source directory for the ted trace editor.
As well as the sources you should find a makefile,
a manual page "ted.manpage", documentation  "ted.tex"
(this preprint is still in review and should be treated
as confidential until it has been accepted for publication)
a help file "ted.help" and a default resources file "Xted".

The "ted.help" and "Xted" files should be placed in the
"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults" directory. The "ted.manpage"
file should be placed in "/usr/man/manl/ted.l", or wherever
local manual pages are stored on your system.

The "ted" application can be constructed by simply typing
"make ted". The "ted" application can then be placed in
a generally accessible directory of binaries, perhaps
"/usr/local/bin".

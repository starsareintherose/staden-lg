The staden suite of sequence analysis programs for the SUN/X11
--------------------------------------------------------------

The contents of this directory should be (at least):
bin		executable sequence analysis programs
help		helpfiles used by these programs
staden.l        manual page
staden.login	csh initialisations
staden.profile	sh initialisations
tables		tables used by the programs

Installers should first print out a copy of the manual page.
This describes the current state of the software and how to
invoke the initialisations. The manual page should be placed
somewhere where `man' can find it.

The directory structure should be position independent. It's
location, however, must be encoded in the environment
variable $STADENROOT. This is described in the man page.


xdap - Sequence assembly program
--------------------------------

This is the source directory for the dap and xdap sequence assembly
programmes, and convert_project.  As well as the sources you should
find a makefile and a default resources file "Xdap".

The "xdap" application can be constructed by simply typing "make xdap",
and installed by typing "make installx" As xdap requires objects from
the "staden" and "ted" directories, it should be made after the staden
package proper and the trace editor have been made.

The default X resource file "Xdap" files is found in
$STADENROOT/tables, and the environment variable XFILESEARCHPATH is set
in staden.login to refer to it. This file could also be placed in the
"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults" directory.

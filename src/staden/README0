The staden suite of sequence analysis programs for the SUN/X11
--------------------------------------------------------------

This is the source directory for the staden suite of programs.
This file describes what its contents are, how to make it and
how to install it. The companion file `README' is to be read
by those who have just installed the suite.

The contents of this directory should be (at least):
                The executable sequence analysis programs
*.f, *.c *.h    The program sources
help		helpfiles used by these programs
makefile
staden.l        manual page
staden.login	csh initialisations
staden.profile	sh initialisations
tables		tables used by the programs

makefile
--------
The makefile needs the macro `SRCDIR' setting before it runs.
There are commands to make individual programs (e.g. `make xpip'),
all the `normal' xterm programs (`make nprogs'), all the X programs
(`make xprogs'), all the programs (`make all') and to install
everything (`make install') and to install bits.

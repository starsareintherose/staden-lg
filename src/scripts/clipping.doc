Marking regions of poor quality                  Simon Dear  Nov 17 1992

Regions of poor quality can be excised using the "clip-seqs" script.
This script takes a file of sequence file names as input, and filters
each to the awk program clip-seq.awk. The sequence files are assumed
to be in staden xdap format. For details on this format, see the
README file in $STADENROOT. The files are modified to reflect the
removal of poor data, while the original sequence is retained in a "~"
suffixed file.

Usage:
	clip-seqs file-of-file-names


Quality clipping is based on a simple analysis of the base content. By
default, it works as follows. The original pre-clipped sequence is
determined from the sequence file. The extents of good quality
sequence is determined for both 5' and 3' ends of the sequence. The
numbers in brackets are set in clip-seq.awk and can be set to suit
local preferences.

At the 3' end: A window of (5) bases is slid down the sequence,
starting from base position (200) until there are (2) Ns within the
window, or until the window reaches position (450), whichever happens
first. The 3' extent of the good data is the set to be (50) bases
upsteam of this position.

At the 5' end: This essentially the same as for the 3' end. The window
is slid back along the sequence starting at base position (100), until
there are sufficient Ns or until the window reaches position (1),
whichever happens first. There is no further adjustment of the 5'
extent of good data.

If there are existing extents in the sequence file, and they are more
conservative than the ones calculated from the sequence, then they
will be the extents used.

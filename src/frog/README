Correcting ABI 373A traces that have had their bases labelled
incorrectly is not a simple matter. The program "frog" is a utility to
swap bases around.

To use frog you will need to know the existing base lane order, and
the correct base order. For example, the base order may currently be
CAGT but examination of the sequence (eg a known cloning site) may
reveal that it should gave been CATG. With this information, simply
run frog as follows:

    frog old new [ABI_files...]

where "old" is the current (incorrect) lane ordering and "new" is the
correct lane ordering.

In the previous example we discovered that the T and G lanes have been
inadvertantly switched. We could correct the file (trace.abi, say) by
typing:

    frog CAGT CATG trace.abi

#
# A database of Staden databases currently using squirrel:
#
# Format:
#
#    <clone> <directory> <project> <version> <database_type> <owner>
#
# Example:
#
# We are sequencing clone CLONE. We have created a bap database 
# called T in the subdirectory TEST of user sd's home directory.
# (Database files would be called ~sd/TEST/T.{SQ,AR,RL,TG,CC}0)
# CLONE would be the name of the project in the edited version of
# the script 'squirrel' that has been copied to ~sd/TEST/.
#
# CLONE TEST T 0 bap sd
#
TESTDB TESTDB TESTDB 0 bap sd

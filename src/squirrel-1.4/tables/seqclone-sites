# Database of sequencing clone cloning and priming sites
#
#    <clone> <clone-site> <forward-primer-site> <reverse-primer-site>
#
# NOTES:
#    clone-site is defined as the base position of the 3' end
#    of the cloning site
#
# Example:
#
# Our sequencing vector is M13mp18, our cloning site is SmaI and
# we are using the -20 forward sequencing primer and the -21
# reverse sequencing primer. With respect to the seqeunce file
# $SQUIRREL/seqs/M13mp18.seq we would have:
#
# M13mp18 6249 41 -24
#
M13mp18 6249 41 -24
pBS     2305 46 -79

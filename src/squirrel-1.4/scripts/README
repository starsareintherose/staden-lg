 Dir: $SQUIRREL/scripts/
Date: Fri May 07 12:13:12 BST 1993

This directory contains all the scripts required by squirrel, plus a
few others. The following concern the users of squirrel directly:

squirrel
	This is the main script that drives squirrel. It should be
	placed in the user's project directory and edited
	appropriately.

packhorse
	This is for merging multiple ABI results folders into one, so
	that squirrel can process them all in one pass.

clean
	This removes results folders, but only if there appears to be
	no files left unprocessed.

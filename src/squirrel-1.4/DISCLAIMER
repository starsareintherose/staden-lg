DISCLAIMER

Squirrel was written by Simon Dear (MRC Laboratory of Molecular
Biology) as a tool to automate the processing of data on the C.elegans
sequencing project. It has been used extensively since May 1992.

The software is not generally applicable to other sequencing projects
without extensive modification. We would like to encourage other
groups to build similar systems based on our version of squirrel. You
are free to use and modify the squirrel software as you see fit. We do
not accept any responsibility for the software as it is distributed or
after it has been modified by you.

0. Introduction

Squizz analyses squirrel reports and produces a breakdown summary
detailing how many readings were assembled and failed, and for what
reasons. The average reading length of processed data is also
calculated.


1. Usage

Run squizz in your project directory. Just type:

	$SQUIRREL/report/squizz

The breakdown summary will be produces quite quickly. The report on
average reading lengths will take a little longer.

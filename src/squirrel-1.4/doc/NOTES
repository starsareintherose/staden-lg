1. Sequence files, cloning sites and vepe

When vepe excises cloning vector, it does not make allowances for the
vector being circular. It also makes no assumptions about the locations
of the splice sites. It is important when setting up the sequence files
($SQUIRREL/seqs) to make allowances for these factors - DO NOT LET THE
SPICE SITE BE TOO NEAR EITHER END OF THE FILE. You may need to edit the
sequence file so that the site lies near the centre of the sequence.

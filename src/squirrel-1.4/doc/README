Here is the documentation on squirrel.


DISCLAIMER -
	Please read first!

SQUIRREL - An overview of squirrel
	A quick guide to the processing phases involved in squirrel.
	Example session files, experiment files, reports and squirrel
	databases (tables) are given.

SysManagement - Maintaining the squirrel databases
	An in depth guide into how to maintain the information squirrel
	needs to process automatically.

Porting.Overview - Getting squirrel working on your system
	A brief overview for those wanting to set up squirrel on their
	system. It gives an overview of what is supplied in the
	package, what changes must be made, and places where it is
	foreseen problems may occur. 

ExperimentFile.format - A guide to experiment files
	Experiment files are the mechanism information is transferred
	between programs in squirrel. Future versions of the Staden
	assembly program will read in experiment files directly. This
	document is useful for those wanting to produce compatible
	files but who do not wish to use squirrel.
	
NOTES - General comments
	Not much here, though an important note for those adding new
	cloning vector files to their squirrel databases.

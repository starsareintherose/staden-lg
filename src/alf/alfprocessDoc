		       ALFPROCESS DOCUMENTATION

alfprocess and alfprocess2 are scripts that take an alf
trace file, break it down into smaller pieces corresponding to
individual clones, and run ted, the trace editor on each one of the
clones.  Afterwards, alfprocess will backup files to tape and move the accepted
files into your project directory.

I. alfprocess

alfprocess is modeled directly on abiprocess, it requires that:

(i) your raw data from the alf is held in the directory ~/alf_e/Results<date>
    where <date> is written 910322a for March 22, 1991 run "a"
    of the day

(ii) it also requires that your project directory is given
     relative to your home directory when it asks you for this name

example usage:

% alfprocess 910322a

II. alfprocess2

alfprocess2 allows you to move into any directory containing your raw
data file (not necessarily ~/alf_e) to process your data.  It will
organize this data file correctly--creating the proper "Results"
directory if necessary.  This is useful if, for example, you have
transferred the file 910322a.alf into the scratch directory
/home/alf_d.  You can then type:

% cd /home/alf_d
% alfprocess2 910322a

And the script will copy this file over to your home directory
~/home/alf_e/Results910322a creating the directory if necessary.  Then
it will do all the normal alfprocess activities.
